# Phenotype application
This repo contains data and code for shiny web-based application (https://cell-phenotype.shinyapps.io/phenotype_search/).

The phenotype application can search for the cell types that are associated with phenotypes by entering the keywords of phenotypes, significance threshold, fold change of expression and standard deviations from mean.
